# Easybee_Jeevana

Our project name is JEEVANA 
The user needes to sign up in the website and register their profile with the essential data. A QR code  unique to their profiles would be generated which can be stuck on vehicles and phones which can be then scanned and read by medical staff. The user needs to upadate the data after a certain duration of time to maintain the relevance at the time of sudden accident.
we planned to create the website using html and css.
wew were not able to develope the database management system.
